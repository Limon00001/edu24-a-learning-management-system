## Major Implementation Challenges & Solutions

1. Files Upload System

- **Challenge:** Implementing progress tracking for large video uploads

- **Solution:**

  - How to Implement:

    1. Create a service to handle file uploads

    2. Track upload progress:

       - Calculate percentage based on loaded vs total bytes
       - Show progress bar to user
       - Update UI in real-time

    3. Handle success/failure states

  - **Tips:**
    1. Use FormData for file handling
    2. Implement progress tracking callback
    3. Show loading indicator for better user experience
    4. Handle network errors
    5. Validate file types and sizes

2. Course Media Management

- **Challenge:** Handling Cloudinary media deletion, especially course images

- **Current Issue:**

  - Videos delete successfully but course images remain in Cloudinary
  - Need to implement proper public_id tracking for course images

3. Payment Integration

- **Challenge:** Implementing secure payment flow with Stripe

- **Solution:**

  - Implementation Flow:
    1. Start payment process
    2. Redirect to Stripe checkout
    3. Handle payment success:
       - Verify payment status
       - Update enrollment status
       - Show success message
       - Redirect to courses page
    4. Handle payment failure:
       - Show error message
       - Allow retry
       - Maintain payment state

- **Key Points:**
  - Secure payment verification
  - Clear user feedback
  - Proper error handling
  - Smooth navigation flow

4. Course Progress Tracking

- **Challenge:** Real-time progress updates for students and streamlining course completion

- **Solution:**

  - How to Calculate:
    1. Get total number of lectures
    2. Track completed lectures
    3. Calculate percentage:
    4. Count completed lectures
    5. Divide by total lectures
    6. Multiply by 100
    7. Round to whole number

## Best Practices

1. Code Organization

   - Separate service layer
   - Context-based state management

2. Security

   - Protected routes
   - JWT token management
   - Secure payment handling

3. User Experience
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Toast notifications
   - Responsive design

## Areas for Improvement

1. Media Management

   - Implement better tracking of Cloudinary assets
   - Improve image deletion functionality

2. State Management

   - Consider using `Redux/Zustand` for complex state
   - Implement better caching

3. Performance
   - Add `Suspense` for lazy loading for routes
   - Implement better video streaming
   - Add client-side caching
